# 🎾 Tennis Match Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the outcomes of tennis matches using machine learning. By analyzing historical data and player statistics, it provides insights into match dynamics and performance trends.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Predict match winners based on historical data.
- Evaluate player performance metrics and trends.
- Analyze head-to-head (H2H) statistics.
- Customizable for different tournaments or time periods.

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aminebenkirane/tennis-prediction.git
   cd tennis-prediction
   
Install dependencies: Use the provided requirements.txt to install all necessary Python libraries.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your data:

Place your historical match data in the data/ folder (e.g., data/matches.csv).
📖 Usage
1. Prepare the Dataset
Ensure your data file (matches.csv) includes:

Player names, rankings, and stats (e.g., first serve %).
Match results (e.g., winner, loser).
Tournament details (e.g., surface, round).
2. Train the Model
Run the training script to create your predictive model.

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
You can adjust training parameters in the configuration file (config.json).

3. Make Predictions
Use the prediction script to forecast outcomes:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input player_stats.json
4. Evaluate the Model
Analyze the model's performance using:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
📊 Data Overview
The project uses historical match data with fields such as:

Player statistics: Win rates, serve accuracy, break points saved, etc.
Match metadata: Tournament surface, player rankings, weather conditions.
Outcomes: Winner and loser information.
Example data snippet:

Match ID	Player A	Player B	Surface	Winner
001	Nadal	Federer	Clay	Nadal
002	Djokovic	Medvedev	Hard	Medvedev
🧠 Machine Learning Approach
The project employs a step-by-step process:

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values.
Normalize player statistics.
Feature Engineering:

Create H2H stats.
Extract performance trends.
Modeling:

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
Cross-validation for robust evaluation.
Evaluation:

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
